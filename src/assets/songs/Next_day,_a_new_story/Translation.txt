Under the night, midst the withering light
Led the way to where you stayed,
Suddenly caught wind of your flirtatious talk.
Your eyes were then awkward, confused
As you saw me when you turned behind
Laughed it off,
I heard my heart contracting.

1,2…3,4,5 silent beats
At you, I am once plagued again with your excuses
My ear hear but my mind say, monologuing like a habit
“Just believe, must believe”
‘Cause we’ll forget it next day.
The night’s fast
It passed too fast
Next day, I’m hearing something new
“Just believe it, must believe it”
So we’ll forget it next day… once again

Your hair has now been shortened more
Your makeup has also differed
And now I realized how far we are apart.
Your eyes has now lost its shyness
When you're with your lover talking.
Laughed it off,
You made my heart contracted.

1,2…3,4,5 silent beats
At you, my sight plagued me again with your excuses
My ear hear but my mind say, monologuing like a habit
“Just believe, must believe”
‘Cause we’ll forget it next day.
The night’s fast
It passed too fast
Next day, I’m hearing something new
“Just believe it, must believe it”
So we’ll forget it next day… once again

There's no need to act like you cared my love
The love we had has always been like that
Xin đừng lừa dối anh
Ngừng lừa dối anh thêm nữa
Em ơi! Em ơi! Em ơi! Em ơiiiiii!

Your eyes has now lost its shyness 
When you're with your lover talking.
Laughed it off,
At me,
At you,
At all the lies that surround us.

My ear hear but my mind say, monologuing like a habit

“Just believe, must believe”
‘Cause we’ll forget it next day.
The night’s fast
It passed too fast
Next day, I’m hearing something new
“Just believe it, must believe it”
So we’ll forget it next day… once again
