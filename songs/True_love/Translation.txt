Spring has arrived, flowers bloom in our hands
And I arrived, changing it all for you
I wish our days peaceful like the sunrises
Our struggle soon passes
Still within my eyes, looking at you

And I recall, the hours you spent waiting
Alone, silent, freezing in rain for me
Our love’s preserved after the darkest storm
Midst this lost wasteland
At this tunnel’s end, you’ll wait for me

As if we have never parted way
Hiding your face in my embrace
For all routes I take will still bring me back to you
As if I’m living my first day
With you throughout my mortal stay
This whole life I had one true love, only for you

And I recall, the hours you spent waiting
Alone, silent, freezing in rain for me
Our love’s preserved after the darkest storm
Midst this lost wasteland
At this tunnel’s end, you’ll wait for me

As if we have never parted way
Hiding your face in my embrace
For all routes I take will still bring me back to you
As if I’m living my first day
With you throughout my mortal stay
This whole life I had one true love, only for you

This whole life I had one true love, only for you
