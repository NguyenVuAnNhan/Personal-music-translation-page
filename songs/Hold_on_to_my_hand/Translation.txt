The day we oathed in joy and bliss
Our only wish for eternal
Each second passed, our eyes shined bright
Our hand in hand, love claim its right

And I’m grateful for this life
To have let you become my wife/love
Each morning I wake up, I shall say
Please love me and be by my side

Hold on my hand tight, keep it for so long
Promise me this oath that will hold for all our life
Till our heart has stopped and our leg has stalled
Then my dearest, keep on believing
Hold on my hand tight, keep it for so long
Promise me this oath that will hold for all our life
Till our heart has stopped and our leg has stalled
Still we’ll be walking the same road
