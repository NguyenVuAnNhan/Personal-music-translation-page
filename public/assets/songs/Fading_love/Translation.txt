Sorrow shadowed
My steps’ aimless midst the vast sea
High clouds hid the silver line
As the wind snuffed out our many dreams’ light

Since the day we met by Fate
Making both time and our hearts race
Letting go the chain and weight of the lives we faced

My dear, I’m that fishing raft
Drifting on the ocean’s path
Away, away go the pain that surround my heart
If there was a time that you knew,
Though our love has grown far and few
My darling, at each day new
In my heart I will always wait for you

Our feelings’ lost
The lonely sea calls for my love
You are now at somewhere else
And happy being with someone else

This life has turned harsh and cold
The day my heart’s caught in your hold
In my dream I suffered as my one love grew bold 

My dear, I’m a hundred birds
In solitude as time passes by
Away, away fly the broken against the sky
If there was a time that you knew,
That I’ll do anything for you
But into a dream you flew
Bringing my heart to where no one knew
