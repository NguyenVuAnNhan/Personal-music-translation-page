And now you cry but it’s all for nothing
It’s not my fault that our love is ending
You gifted away your tears and its meaning
As time fades away

If…our hearts have now been silenced
Our love now tastes like poison
It is…what it is

And today you came
Sunshine has stopped calling your name
The wind stays silent, the same
Why must you come?

And now our love remained nothing but dust
When spring arrives, whispering love and lust
You stepped aside, waiting for lady luck
Like our first days

And now you cry but it’s all for nothing
It’s not my fault that our love is ending
You gifted away your tears and its meaning
As time fades away

If…that red rose could have returned
Love's scent flows as our oath burns
I wish for

A day that soon comes
When I and you face tomorrow
But that's a path we can not go
Why can't we go?

And now our love remained nothing but dust
When spring arrives, whispering love and lust
You stepped aside, waiting for lady luck
Like our first days

And now you cry but it’s all for nothing
It’s not my fault that our love is ending
You gifted away your tears and its meaning
As time fades away

And now our love remained nothing but dust
When spring arrives, whispering love and lust
You stepped aside, waiting for lady luck
Like our first days

And now you cry but it’s all for nothing
It’s not my fault that our love is ending
From your eyes flow your tears and its meaning
It was (y)our fault.
